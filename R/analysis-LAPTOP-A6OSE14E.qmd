## `get_trait_asso` 

`get_trait_asso` returns associations, possibly from multiple studies, for a single trait, encoded by its EFO identifier.

In the query result, there is a column called `study_accession`, which identifies the study. 

We probably need to limit MR analysis to a single study accession value for exposure and one for outcome. 

```{r}
efo_dm <- "EFO_0000400" # https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%252Fefo%252FEFO_0000400
dm_asso <- get_trait_asso(trait = efo_dm, size = 100)
```
