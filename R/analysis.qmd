## `get_trait_asso` 

`get_trait_asso` returns associations, possibly from multiple studies, for a single trait, encoded by its EFO identifier.

In the query result, there is a column called `study_accession`, which identifies the study. 

We probably need to limit MR analysis to a single study accession value for exposure and one for outcome. 

```{r}
efo_dm <- "EFO_0000400" # https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/efo/classes/http%253A%252F%252Fwww.ebi.ac.uk%252Fefo%252FEFO_0000400
get_trait_asso(trait = efo_dm, p_upper = 1E-08)
```

## Another work flow

We might first look up, for a given EFO trait, the unique study accession numbers for it. Then, user chooses one study accession id, we query api for associations (specific to the study accession id and trait EFO value).

```{r}

```
